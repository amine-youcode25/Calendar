# Gourmet Calendar Reservation

This is a small web project I built during my training.  
The goal was to create a simple **calendar system** where users can **add, edit, and delete reservations** using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap**.

## About the Project

I used **Bootstrap** for the layout and grid system because it made it easier to organize the calendar structure.  
Each day is represented by a **column**, and I used several **rows** to represent the full month.  

When the user clicks on a day, a **form** appears allowing them to fill in:

- Client name  
- Start and end time  
- Number of people  
- Type of reservation (Standard, VIP, Birthday, or Group)

After submitting, the reservation appears inside that day’s cell with a **specific color** depending on the type of reservation.  
Users can also hover to see **edit** and **delete** buttons.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3 / Bootstrap 5**  
- **JavaScript**  
- **Font Awesome** (for icons)

## How to Use

1. Open the file **index.html** in your browser.  
2. Click on any **day** in the calendar to open the reservation form.  
3. Fill in the required fields and click **Add Reservation**.  
4. Hover over a reservation to **edit** or **delete** it.  

No installation or server setup is required — it runs completely in the browser.

## What I Learned

This project helped me understand:

- How to use **event listeners** in JavaScript  
- How to manipulate the **DOM** dynamically  
- How to combine **Bootstrap classes** with custom CSS  
- How to debug logical errors and small layout issues  
- How to make a page more **responsive and user-friendly**  

It was also my first time implementing a logic for editing and restoring reservations.  
It was challenging at first, but I learned a lot from it.

## Notes and Possible Improvements

- Improve mobile responsiveness on smaller screens  
- Add persistent data using **localStorage**  
- Allow navigation between different months  
- Refine the layout and overflow handling
